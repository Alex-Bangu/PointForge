Our team used AI for the following:

1. Formatting login.css and the login.jsx return statement (the html in there).
2. Creating seed data
3. hard coding the language translations
4. figuring out the color blind settings
5. determining the best way to organize the frontend components
6. getting advice on how we could refactor our code to make it more clean, readable, and less redundant
